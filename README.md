# 2300009HAssessmentTasks
Both RSE Assessment Task 1 and 2.
Both Tasks were originally written in Python then i saw C++ listed as desirable so I also wrote the 2nd Task in C++.
They are the same program in both languages and produce the same result so there is no need to check both I just felt I would do both to showcase my ability.
Only the Python code is commented.
I only did task one is python.
