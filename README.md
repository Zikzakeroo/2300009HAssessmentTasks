# 2300009HAssessmentTasks by Zakaria Loizou
Both RSE Assessment Task 1 and 2.
The .py files are the source code to Task 1 and 2 written in python. I also rewrote the 2nd Task in C++ when I saw it listed as a desirable language but I left the first task as is as I felt in lent itself better to python. The pyhton code is commented for both tasks. You can Ignore it if you want it is the same program and produces the same result.
The two word documents are just my answsers to the questions and the source code in text format.
